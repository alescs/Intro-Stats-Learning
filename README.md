Exercises in Python for "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)

This repository stores notes and exercises (in Python) for "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R".

This is not intended to be an exhaustive collection of answers to the exercises in the book, in fact, many are missing: I skip them if they require little or no coding at all, if I don't find them particularly useful, or if I simply not like them.

When I do them, on the other hand, I try to give a correct answer, if possible. This does not mean that they are always correct, as I have not double checked them with other sources.
