Exercises in Python for "An Introduction to Statistical Learning"

This repository stores notes and exercises (in Python) for "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R".

This collection is not intended to be an exhaustive collection of answers to the exercises in the book. For example, answers 
that require little or no coding at all (see "conceptual exercises" sections) are not included or to those questions that, for one
reason or another, I have decided to skip.

When I do an exercise, I try, as much as I can, to give a correct answers, but, clearly, not having access to the solutions, there is no
guaranteee that they are really correct.
